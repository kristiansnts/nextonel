## Phase 1 Status ✅

**Completed Tasks:**
1. ✅ Analyzed current project structure
2. ✅ Identified reusable components vs. project-specific code
3. ✅ Created PACKAGE.md documentation
4. ✅ Restructured components for package distribution
5. ✅ Set up TypeScript build configuration (tsup)
6. ✅ Created proper export structure

**Files Created:**
- `src/index.ts` - Main package entry with re-exports
- `src/components/index.ts` - Component export structure
- `src/lib/index.ts` - Utility export structure
- `src/hooks/index.ts` - Hook export structure
- `src/types/index.ts` - Type export structure
- `tsup.config.ts` - Build configuration for package bundling

**Package.json Updates:**
- Added `build:package` script for building the package
- Added `build:package:watch` script for development
- Added `tsup@^8.0.0` as dev dependency

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

The next phase will involve:
1. Copying reusable UI components to `src/components/`
2. Setting up proper exports for Form Builder system
3. Setting up proper exports for Data Table system
4. Extracting and organizing types
5. Creating template files for CLI generation

## Build Commands

```bash
# Build the package (outputs to dist/)
pnpm build:package

# Build the package in watch mode
pnpm build:package:watch
```

## Notes

- All exports are currently placeholders
- Components will be copied in Phase 2
- The build configuration excludes Next.js-specific code
- Templates for CLI will be created in a separate `templates/` directory
