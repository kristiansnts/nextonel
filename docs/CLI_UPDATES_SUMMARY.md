# CLI Updates Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-18
**Version**: 0.1.0
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

---

## Overview

This document summarizes all the CLI updates made to ShadPanel, including:
1. **Local Tarball Installation Fix** - Fixed NPM registry installation errors
2. **Installation Types Feature** - Added 3 installation modes for different use cases

---

## Update 1: Local Tarball Installation Fix

### Problem
When running `npx shadpanel init`, the CLI failed with NPM registry errors because it tried to fetch `shadpanel@0.1.0` from the public NPM registry, but the package wasn't published yet.

### Solution
Modified the CLI to install from the local `.tgz` file instead of the NPM registry during development.

### Changes Made

**1. Updated [cli/utils/dependencies.ts](../cli/utils/dependencies.ts)**
- Added `localTarballPath` option to `updatePackageJson()`
- Replaces `"shadpanel": "0.1.0"` with `"shadpanel": "file:/path/to/tarball"`

**2. Updated [cli/commands/init.ts](../cli/commands/init.ts)**
- Pass local tarball path to `updatePackageJson()`
- Ensures local installation during development

### Result
✅ `npm install` now works correctly with local tarball
✅ No more NPM registry 404 errors
✅ Faster development iteration

**Documentation**: [docs/LOCAL_TARBALL_FIX.md](./LOCAL_TARBALL_FIX.md)

## Update 2: Installation Types Feature

### Feature
Added 3 installation types to accommodate different project needs:

1. **Full Panel with Auth** (Recommended for fresh Next.js installations)
   - Complete admin panel with sidebar, auth, demos

2. **Auth + Components**
   - Authentication system + UI components (no full panel)

3. **Components Only**
   - Just UI components (no auth, no panel)

### Changes Made

**1. Updated [cli/utils/prompts.ts](../cli/utils/prompts.ts)**
- Added `InstallationType` type
- Added `installationType` field to `InitAnswers`
- Added installation type selection as first prompt
- Made auth/demo prompts conditional based on installation type

**2. Updated [cli/commands/init.ts](../cli/commands/init.ts)**
- Conditional template copying based on `installationType`
- Only copy base template for `full-panel`
- Only copy demos for `full-panel`
- Pass installation type to completion message

**3. Updated [cli/utils/logger.ts](../cli/utils/logger.ts)**
- Different success messages for each installation type
- Customized "Get started" instructions

### Result
✅ Users can choose installation type based on needs
✅ Reduced bloat for existing projects
✅ Clear UX with appropriate options
✅ Better onboarding for different use cases

**Documentation**: [docs/INSTALLATION_TYPES.md](./INSTALLATION_TYPES.md)
